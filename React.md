### What is JSX (const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;)
- JSX is not a string not HTML, JSX stand for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of javascript. It allows us to directly write HTML <br />
in react (within javascript code). Instead of separating the markup and logic in separated files, React uses components for this purpose.
- At build time the JSX is compiled into imperative JavaScript code. At runtime this code is loaded into the browser and executed. Both Babel and <br />
TypeScript can compile JSX into JavaScript. Therefore it integrates easily into a modern JavaScript build setup where either Babel or TypeScript are typically used.
