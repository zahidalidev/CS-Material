# Vue.js 3
- Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.
- The core Vue library is focused on one thing and doing that one thing really well which is building user interfaces.
- Vue does not focus on the other aspects of your application like routing or HTTP requests.
