## What is Cloud computing
- The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data, rahter than a local server or a personal computer.
 
## Service Models
### SaaS - Software as a Service
- Cloud Provider leases application or softwares which are owned by them to its client. for example Gmail we just you gmail as a service to send emails and everything is manages by Gmail.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service
- Here you are provided with a platform which you can use to build your own applications, for example Google app engine where you can create your own applications and put it on Google app engine so that others can use it as well.

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- The whole infrastructure is provided to you so you can create your own applications. That is an underlying structure is given to you based on that you can choose your operating systems, the kind of technology to use on that platform, the application you want to build and all those things so that is what IaaS is.

## Deployment Models
- We have three type of clouds, Public Cloud, Private Cloud and Hybrid Cloud.

### Public Cloud
- Available to everyone.
- A service provider make resources, such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet.
- Easy and inexpensive set-up because hardware, application and bandwitdh costs are covered by the provider.
- No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.
- All you have to do is to rent this cloud and can use and it is available publicly.

### Private Cloud
- 

### IAM (Identity and access management, Global Service)
- By default root account is created so we should not share it with anyone. We can create groups with some specific access and users can be in many groups.
